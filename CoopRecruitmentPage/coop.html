                <h3>The Co-op Experience</h3>
                
                <p>We know how to run a great co-op program. In fact, most of our full time employees actually had co-ops with us. We truly want to help develop the skills that make you hire-able -- preferably by us!<br/><br/>
				
				In order to maximize the co-op experience, we strongly prefer that you have more than one co-op experience with us. This enables you to get an optimal experience with different projects, technologies, and team members so you can explore the many facets of software development and discover what you really love to do.<br/><br/>
				
				A co-op experience with RIDGID Software Solutions will give you experience with tons of great technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, responsive web design, Object Oriented Programming and high level languages (e.g. C#, Java, Objective C, etc.), data persistence (e.g. Relational and Document Store/NoSQL Databases), web services, unit testing, Test Driven Development (TDD), Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD), and &lt;<i>insert other awesome technology buzzwords here</i>&gt;.</p>
